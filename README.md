# SlimyBees
SlimyBees is a Slimefun4 addon heavily inspired by the bee portion of the famous MC mod,
[Forestry](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forestry).
It adds many bee species which can be discovered, bred and used to produce various materials.
The productivity of each bee is also determined by its allele values,
which can be improved by selective breeding, offering a fun mini-game for the endgame stages. 

## Features
Features currently include:
* Bee Hive world generation
* The ability to breed bees to discover new species
* Basic set of species (mainly honey production for now)
